Welcome to my profile! I'm adaptony.

# What'll I find here?

My interests at the moment lie in contributing to FOSS and maintaining some open and closed source software as well.

I'm very interested in UNIX-like operating systems - including Linux/GNU distributions and FreeBSD, so you might see some contributions to those platforms specifically.
## PS

I'll add some more information here once I see it fit!
